Zendesk Ticket Viewer Coding Challenge

## How to run app
`ruby lib/app.rb`

## How to run test
`rspec`

## Implemention details
The goal of this challenge is to write a ticket viewer which allows the user to view their tickets.

`app.rb` is the main entry point of this app
`router.rb` controls the menus display and interactions with the user

- Connect to the Zendesk API via user email address and password
`ticket_gateway.rb` is responsible for user verification and make API call

- Parse JSON data returned by Zendesk API to get all the tickets from the user account
`ticket_controller.rb` is responsible for fetching ticket or tickets according to the user's request,
  and call `ticket_view.rb` or `tickets_view.rb` to display

- Display them in a list
`tickets_view.rb` displays tickets in one table

- View individual ticket details
`ticket_view.rb` displays individual ticket details

The ticket model is created but has not been used.

## What can be improved
### Performance
1. Currently, offsets pagination is used, which will fetch one page, 25 tickets per page, at one time.
But the app is fetching data whenever it has been called.
However, if one page has been fetched, supposedly can be stored in memory to avoid multiple API calls.

### Security
2. There is a security risk, as user email and token for API authentication are stored in the app and pushed to GitHub.
Should be a way to encrypt the email and token.

### Testing
3. Only did unit tests and manual tests, but no auto integration test.


## Flowchart

‣ 1. View all tickets
